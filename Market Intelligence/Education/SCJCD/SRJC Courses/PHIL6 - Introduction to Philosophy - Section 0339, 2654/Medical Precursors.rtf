\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec4 With the\'a0Pangenome Project,\'a0Human Cell Atlas, and Unified Theory of Neurodevelopment, scientists can fully map the entire human genome as a means to supplement tools like\'a0CRISPR-GPT, CRISPR-Cas9, base and prime editing, tissue nanotransfection, and\'a0vitro gametogenesis, which would\'a0allow precise genetic and cellular engineering. Osseointegration\'a0could fuse machine parts seamlessly if desired for combat or durability.\'a0Artificial wombs (EXTrauterine Environment)\'a0would allow complete gestation outside a human body, and\'a0wetware or organoid intelligence (OI)\'a0could provide a foundation for cognition and learning.\
\
Combined, these technologies make it feasible to create bio-synthetic beings that behave, look, and even learn like humans. Depending on how organoid intelligence is integrated, they could potentially exhibit forms of consciousness that mirror our social awareness and emotional expression, so much so that it'll require watermarked fingerprints and DNA to identify them.}
